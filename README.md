## Description 

The goal of this project is to create a fun pub quiz game. Players can compete with friends by answering random questions on different topics. The game has rounds, and in each round, 5 random questions are asked. For every correct answer, the player gets 10 points. If the answer is wrong, they get 0 points. Players won't know if their answers are right or wrong until the end of the game. At the end, the game shows how many questions were answered correctly, and the total score is given. The idea is to have a good time with friends and see who knows the most.

## Bugs

| Bug | Solution |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| 1. Images from background do not loading  |Path was corrected  |
| 2. Botton with JavaScript to start de game again, did not work after deployment.  | After a lot of try and error, I decided to change plans and use HTML anchor tag to fix it.
| 3. Game options would overlap on small screens.  | CSS media queries were added to adjust the layout and font size for smaller screen widths. |
| 4. The Letâ€™s Play button was misaligned on mobile.  | Padding and margins were adjusted using media queries to center the button correctly on all screen sizes. |
